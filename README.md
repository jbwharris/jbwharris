- 👋 Hi, I’m @jbwharris, I'm a UI designer, developer and dabbler. 
- 👀 I’m interested in tools that integrate with last.fm for scrobbling and manipulating data pulled from there in cool ways. I'm also keen on the Hackintoshing scene, having built multiple PCs capable of running macOS over the last decade plus. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and headless WordPress builds using Frontity. I've also been dabbling with 11ty for the same purposes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on last.fm projects. I can do UI concepts or contribute frontend code if required.
